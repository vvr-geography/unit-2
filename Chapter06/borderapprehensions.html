                        “Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they’ll get sent back. More
                        importantly, they may not make it.” - President Barack Obama
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Obama’s warning, delivered at the height of what his administration described as a humanitarian
                        crisis at the southern border, was part of the escalation in anti-immigrant rhetoric that
                        emerged in 2014. The 2014 Border Crisis, as it is commonly described, gestures to the
                        significant uptick in Central American unaccompanied children and families with young children
                        migrating to the United States along the Southwestern border, and particularly at one sector of
                        the Customs and Border Patrol — the Rio Grande Valley. In the public discourse, the crisis was
                        framed alongside calls for “common sense immigration reform” that would keep the border secure
                        by “protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals” while articulating the economic
                        and social benefits of immigrants already in the United States and who “play by the rules”
                        (source). These statements were accompanied by a slate of executive actions that expanded
                        migrant detention (particularly for families and children), outsourced certain border patrol
                        operations to Central American countries, and invested in technology, infrastructure, and
                        resources along the southwestern border.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These unprecedented interventions set the scene for the future of border security for the
                        remainder of the Obama administration and the soon-to-come Trump administration.

                    <h3>
                        “At this very moment, large, well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our
                        southern border. Some people call it an ‘invasion.’ It’s like an invasion. They have violently
                        overrun the Mexican border.” - President Donald Trump
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The Obama era calls for “commonsense immigration reform” were replaced in 2016 by President
                        Trump’s increasingly violent and public calls to secure the border from “dangerous influxes” of
                        immigrants at the southwestern border. This rhetoric reached a peak during in 2018, when a
                        “caravan” of migrants from Central America approached the border. This resulted in executive
                        orders to construct a physical border wall, as well as efforts to expand immigrant detention and
                        border patrol forces, while limiting asylum protections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These policy changes were mirrored by an increasing militarization of the border region that
                        eroded constitutional protections and human rights along the southwestern border (source). The
                        militarization of the border has meant an increase in the U.S. Border Patrol access to resources
                        and authority, hiring of military veterans and use of military surplus in the border region, and
                        a culture of violence and abuse that curtails human rights at the border (source). In other
                        words, border militarization has increased the risks to the safety of migrants by expanded
                        violent systems that treat migrants like enemy combatants, to be deported and detained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Trump administration rhetoric on border security has also inspired an uptick in far-right
                        border vigilantes that have mobilized at the southern border to defend against this “invasion,”
                        sometimes even collaborating with the U.S. Border Patrol to apprehend migrants (source). While
                        Trump had called for National Guard troops to mobilize at the border, these far right militias
                        organized to patrol the border as well. Particularly well publicized was a viral incident from
                        New Mexico in April 2019, when Larry Hopkins and his United Constitutional Patriots armed
                        militia group kidnapped and detained a large group of migrants at the border. While the Border
                        Patrol claims not endorse the activities of these border militias, there’s a long history of
                        collaboration between white supremacist militia groups and the Border Patrol, that is grounded
                        in violent histories of American border (source).
